##Mini Projects
The code in this folder encompasses different 'mini' projects that we're working on.
This serves two purposes:
* Get better acquainted with the Sage library and put it to work on a real-world application.
* Have something to show for our semester evaluation.

###Contributing
Please make a folder here with the name of your miniproject (for eg., 'broken_hashes'), and commit there.
